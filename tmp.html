<p class="c6 title" id="h.fz7jk1y7z7vk"><span class=
"c9">Introduction to Evolve</span></p>
<h1 class="c5" id="h.jorv4r5patim"><span class="c7">What is
Evolve?</span></h1>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Evolve is a concept for a new way
for humans to self-organise and relate. It has many aspects, and
can be framed differently depending on context.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the simplest, and most familiar
perspective, Evolve is a &ldquo;transformational&rdquo; festival; a
gathering of people on land to connect with themselves and each
other in a ritual that breaks them out of the routine of everyday
life.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Evolve is also a conference. It is a
place for people to come together and share knowledge, wisdom, and
skills, especially those which help us to collectively grow and
evolve.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Evolve is a movement. Part of the
concept is that Evolve will grow from the first festival into many
festivals around the world, allowing as many people as possible to
experience, even if only for a few days, being out of &ldquo;the
matrix&rdquo; and living in a different, richer, more connected way
than most of us currently live.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Evolve is an experiment in
decentralised governance and participatory democracy. We believe in
the wisdom of crowds -- the concept that, with the right frameworks
and systems in place, large groups can make better decisions for
the collective than individuals or small groups (in part because
the latter are prone to capture and corruption).</span></p>
<h1 class="c5" id="h.ytsgvx6fs1jc"><span class="c7">Why
Evolve?</span></h1>
<p class="c2"><span>We believe that human</span>
<span>civilisation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(and to a lesser
extent, the biosphere itself) is coming to a crossroads. We have
reached a situation where our technological power (for example,
nuclear weapons, biotech, fossil fuels, AI, nanotechnology) have
surpassed our ability to make good decisions, and as such
we&rsquo;re faced with the very real possibility of destruction of
our civilisation and perhaps our species itself. This is not to
mention the impact we&rsquo;re already having on countless other
species on the planet.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">One solution to this problem is a
top-down technocratic dystopia. This might avoid civilizational
collapse, but is likely not a future any of us want for our
children / grandchildren.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">On top of merely avoiding
catastrophe, we also dream about a future which is more beautiful,
more connected, more kind, and more loving than what we have
today.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">We believe that in order to create
such a future, we need grass-roots, decentralised culture change,
and better ways to self-govern. As a species, we need to evolve
both individually and collectively.</span></p>
<h1 class="c5" id="h.3zy1qda7rx50"><span class="c7">Vision of
Evolve</span></h1>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are multiple layers to the
vision for Evolve.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">At its most simple, we envisage
Evolve becoming a festival that brings people together to
celebrate, share, and learn, hopefully improving the lives of
hundreds or thousands of people. If this is all that Evolve
achieves, this would feel like success.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next level of the vision is the
movement. Here we see the Evolve festival propagating itself around
the globe, and increasing the number of people impacted by an order
of magnitude. These events would work together to support one
another and make collective decisions that improve the Evolve
ecosystem for all involved.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beyond this, we can imagine Evolve
started to seed more permanent intentional communities of people
living together, and modelling their communities on Evolve&rsquo;s
principles and ways of doing governance. These communities would be
part of the greater web, and would also share support and resources
with the events and each other.</span></p>
<p class="c2 c3"></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our blue-sky vision for Evolve is
that it inspires or becomes a new way for humans to organise and
govern ourselves and steward the planet; one which is more
connective, more attuned, and more alive. We imagine deep culture
change that brings humanity more in harmony with each other and
with the planet we live on and with.</span></p>
<h1 class="c5" id="h.b6egvg97zzk1"><span class="c7">Principles of
Evolve</span></h1>
<ul class="c8 lst-kix_wtptp7fm2mos-0 start">
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Love</span><span class=
"c0">&nbsp;(as defined by M. Scott Peck): The will to extend one's
self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual
growth. We believe that love (in the prior sense, as opposed to the
distorted version sold by popular culture &mdash; dependency,
control, obsession, desire, lust) is our collective
purpose.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class=
"c1">Decentralisation</span><span class="c0">: One of the primary
challenges of modern society is that we have tended towards
centralised organisation (e.g., governments, the military,
Hollywood, corporations). The primary advantage of centralised
organisation is that it&rsquo;s efficient, but its disadvantages
are myriad: corruption (power corrupts), ossification, and extreme
power/wealth imbalance. Modern technology (blockchain) provides a
way to have decentralised organisation which is much more efficient
and scalable than in the past.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Learning and
growth:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Modern civilisation is
obsessed with learning and growth, but in very narrow dimensions,
specifically scientific learning and economic growth. These are
useful, but limited. Evolve widens the lens (as do many other
transformative festivals) to support the full gamut of learning and
growth. Part of this will happen through workshops gifted by
attendees, and part through spontaneous sharing and
play.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Gifting and
generosity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The mythology of
capitalism tells us that everyone is selfish and looking out only
for their own self-interest. Real-life human and animal behaviour
belie this belief. Evolve encourages generosity of spirit and the
joy of sharing our gifts with each other.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class=
"c1">Play:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Is both an integral part of
a joyful and well-lived life, and also one of the best vehicles for
true learning and growth. Humans who do not play are prone to
becoming captured by ideology or despondence. This can become
self-perpetuating, as ideologies and despondence are often
antithetical to play. Play also builds connection.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class=
"c1">Connection:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We are all
interconnected, all humans, all living and non-living things. We
are all interdependent. Part of what makes us different as human
beings is our ability to temporarily forget this. Our unbalanced
belief in our own egoic separateness has led us to do all sorts of
(potentially irreparable) damage to the ecosystem in which we live.
The way back from this precipice lies in remembering our
interconnectedness and interdependence. This can be facilitated by
spending unstructured time with others, in play, and in
nature.</span></li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class=
"c1">Sustainability:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sustainability is
a fundamental principle for Evolve. We believe that the lack of
sustainability is one of the core problems in our existing culture.
To move away from the modern concepts of time as a strictly linear
construct, Evolve embraces more ancient ways of seeing time as, at
least in part, a cyclic phenomenon. We do not see the world as a
set of "resources" to be consumed and excreted in the quest for
endless material growth. Instead, we see our role in the larger
ecosystem as one of giving and receiving, inhaling and exhaling.
Thus, Evolve strives to minimise waste and prioritises syntropy
with a vision of thriving future generations of all living
beings.</span></li>
